     * It will return a list of QPluginLoader that match your
     * specifications.  The only required parameter is the service
     * type.  This is something like 'text/plain' or 'text/html'.  The
     * constraint parameter is used to limit the possible choices
     * returned based on the constraints you give it.
     *
     * The @p constraint language is rather full.  The most common
     * keywords are AND, OR, NOT, IN, and EXIST, all used in an
     * almost spoken-word form.  An example is:
     * \code
     * (Type == 'Service') and (('KParts/ReadOnlyPart' in ServiceTypes) or (exist Exec))
     * \endcode
     *
     * The keys used in the query (Type, ServiceType, Exec) are all
     * fields found in the .desktop files.
     *
     * @param servicetype A service type like 'KMyApp/Plugin' or 'KFilePlugin'.
     * @param constraint  A constraint to limit the choices returned, QString() to
     *                    get all services of the given @p servicetype
     *
     * @return A list of QPluginLoader that satisfy the query
     * @see http://techbase.kde.org/Development/Tutorials/Services/Traders#The_KTrader_Query_Language
