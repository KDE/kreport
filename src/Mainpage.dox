    %KReport is a framework for the creation and generation of reports in multiple formats.

 The KReport framework implements reporting functionality for creation
 of <a href="https://support.office.com/article/e0869f59-7536-4d19-8e05-7158dcd3681c">reports
 in MS Access</a> style. They are also similar to <a href="http://www.sap.com/solution/sme/software/analytics/crystal-reports/index.html">
 SAP Crystal Reports</a> and <a href="http://help.filemaker.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/13754">
 FileMaker reports</a>.

 Reports can be created interactively and programmatically. They can be previewed on screen,
 printed, and saved in a variety of formats such as HTML, PDF and OpenDocument.
 Reports of this kind offer a way to view, format, and summarize the information.
 For example a simple report of contact phone numbers can be prepared, or a more complex
 report on sales for different products, regions, and periods of time.

 A report is often filled with information from a database. There are many use cases:
 - The data can be displayed, summarized, sorted and grouped
 - Totals can be computed and displayed
 - Single or multiple records of data can be placed on a page
 - Details for individual data records can be placed in a layout
 - Labels can be created
 - The various report sections, such as title, header or footer, can be sized to suit
 - Reports can be generated on demand, thus eliminating saving them in files for further use
